Desktop App Development
Electron Developer: Builds cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. Core responsibilities include writing code in JavaScript/TypeScript, designing the user interface with HTML/CSS, integrating Node.js modules and back-end APIs, and debugging for performance and stability across Windows, macOS, and Linux .

Qt Developer (C++): Develops applications using the Qt framework for high-performance or specialized interfaces (e.g., in engineering or finance). They design and code in C++, manage multithreading, and ensure the UI is responsive and maintainable .

C#/.NET Developer: Creates applications for the Windows ecosystem, including desktop clients and business software. They write and maintain code in C#, design data models, integrate with SQL Server databases, and often use frameworks like Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for the UI .

Swift Developer: Builds native applications exclusively for Apple's macOS and Mac computers. Their work involves using Swift and Apple's Cocoa frameworks to create performant, integrated apps that follow macOS design guidelines .

Linux Desktop Developer: Develops software for Linux-based desktop environments. This includes creating applications with toolkits like GTK+ or Qt, ensuring compatibility across distributions, and writing scripts to manage packaging and system integration .

Mobile App (iOS/Android)
Mobile UI/UX Designer: Focuses on the mobile user's experience and interface. They conduct user research, create wireframes and interactive prototypes, design intuitive visual interfaces, and work closely with developers to ensure the final product matches the design vision and usability goals .

Mobile QA Engineer: Ensures mobile apps are stable and high-quality. They design test plans, execute manual and automated tests on various devices and OS versions, report bugs, and perform regression testing .

Mobile DevOps (CI/CD): Specializes in the mobile app release pipeline. They manage code signing and provisioning profiles, automate builds, run tests, and manage deployments to app stores or internal distribution channels.

Push Notifications Engineer: Manages the delivery of notifications to mobile devices. They integrate with services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs), handle token registration, and build systems for targeted and timely notification delivery.

Bot API Services
API Documentation Writer: Creates clear, accurate, and comprehensive documentation for the Bot API. They write tutorials, generate API reference docs from code, and create code samples to help third-party developers build bots effectively.

SDK Developer: Develops Software Development Kits (SDKs) in languages like Python, JavaScript, or Go to simplify Bot API integration. They design a clean abstraction layer over the raw API, handle authentication, serialization, and error handling within the SDK.

Bot Platform Engineer: Builds and maintains the core infrastructure for the bot platform. They design the API architecture, ensure scalability and security, manage bot state and webhooks, and implement features like inline queries and payments.

Developer Relations (DevRel): Acts as the bridge between the platform and its developer community. They create sample bots and tutorials, gather developer feedback to inform the product roadmap, provide technical support, and advocate for developers' needs within the company.

Media & File Service
Media Processing Engineer: Builds systems to handle media files. They use tools like FFmpeg to transcode video and audio into different formats, generate thumbnails, compress images, and implement streaming protocols (e.g., HLS, DASH).

Storage Engineer: Designs and manages the systems that store billions of files. They work with object storage (like S3), implement data replication and backup strategies, manage CDN integration, and optimize for cost and performance .

CDN Engineer: Ensures fast global delivery of media and static files. They configure and manage CDN providers, implement caching rules and purging strategies, and monitor edge performance and traffic costs.

Video Streaming Specialist: Focuses on delivering real-time or on-demand video. They optimize encoding profiles for quality and bandwidth, implement adaptive bitrate streaming, manage WebRTC sessions for live streaming, and monitor playback quality metrics.

Backend Services
Go/Rust Developer: Writes high-performance, concurrent backend services. They build microservices for specific features (chat, presence, billing), design efficient data structures, and ensure low-latency response times for a global user base.

Scalability Engineer: Focuses on keeping the service running smoothly under massive load. They perform load testing, optimize database queries, implement caching layers (Redis, Memcached), design sharding strategies, and manage service discovery in a microservices architecture.

Database Engineer: Manages the persistent data layer. They design schemas for relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational databases, plan for replication and high availability, perform query optimization, and manage data migration strategies.

Secret Chat Relay
Cryptography Engineer: Implements the core encryption protocols for end-to-end encrypted chats. They design and audit cryptographic schemes for key exchange, message encryption, and forward secrecy, ensuring the mathematical security of the system.

Security Researcher: Proactively searches for vulnerabilities in the protocol and its implementations. They conduct threat modeling, perform penetration testing, analyze code for security flaws, and work with engineers to develop patches.

Protocol Security Engineer: Focuses on the security of the network protocol itself. They design the protocol to resist man-in-the-middle attacks, ensure proper authentication, and safeguard metadata to prevent traffic analysis.
